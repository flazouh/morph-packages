/**
 * The settings store a browser extension can offer, and only a browser
 * extension.
 *
 * Kept apart from `settingsStore` because that one is platform-agnostic by
 * construction — it takes somewhere to put things by name and does all the
 * deciding itself — and this one reaches for `browser`, a global that exists
 * only where an extension is running. In one file, importing the agnostic half
 * meant importing the global too, which is a typecheck a desktop app cannot
 * pass and a bundle it should not carry.
 *
 * Not there covers two cases worth keeping apart in the head: a test, where
 * there is no extension at all, and a browser that has taken the permission
 * away — from the interface's side both mean the same thing, which is that
 * choices apply to this page and are gone with it.
