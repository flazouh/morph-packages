 * same reasoning, and the public record does not support it — see
 * `research/pages-to-replace.md` in the notes repository, which ranks this the
 * first page left worth replacing and calls the evidence very high.
 *
 * GitHub's own engineering post about that tab, 3 April 2026: a JavaScript heap
 * over a gigabyte on large pull requests, more than four hundred thousand DOM
 * nodes, an INP around 450ms on a ten-thousand-line split diff, and a hard cap at
 * one to three thousand files. Their own fix was to virtualize p95 diffs, which
 * took INP from 275–700ms down to 40–80ms — an admission of the size of the
 * problem rather than a reason to leave the page alone.
 *
 * It is also the review surface, which is this product's whole vision. This
 * interface already draws every file of a pull request inside its own screen; all
 * that address ever needed was to be read.

 * what it opens on. A reader who pressed "Files changed" asked for the diff, and

 *
 * Two words for it, because GitHub is mid-rename: `/files` is what every link ever
 * written points at and what their own redirect still accepts, and `/changes` is
 * what that redirect now lands on. Read live on 2026-09-02, following `/files`
 * arrives at `/changes`. Reading only the new one would ignore every bookmark and
 * every link in every issue; reading only the old one would ignore the address the
