/**
 * What the Rail knows without asking GitHub anything.
 *
 * The Rail is the strip of navigation on every screen this extension renders, and the
 * longest list on it is the Participant's repositories. GitHub's own version of that list
 * — "Top repositories" in their home sidebar — is ranked by where a reader has been, and
 * their own readers say so: the sidebar is one of two duplicated lists they asked to have
 * removed, and the thing they wanted instead was where their work is.
 *
 * Which the Working Set already knows. Every row it draws names a repository, so this
 * list is a fold over a read that has already happened: no request, no port method, no
 * cache. See `docs/spec/home.md`, where this is the first of three reads and deliberately
 * the cheapest.
