 * is three quarters of a megabyte for one large pull request and the reason a
 * list has never shown a size before.
 *
 * A row whose read failed keeps no size rather than a zero. Both lists draw a row
 * without one — every row looks like that for the first second — and a four

 * request's payload and carries no id at all, and every layer of a chain is in
 * one repository, so the number names it and nothing else has to be carried
 * down to the row that draws it.
 *
 * Reported through `tell` as each answer arrives rather than gathered into a map
 * at the end. The rows this is for are already on the screen and linking up, and
 * the first count is worth drawing on the row it belongs to whether or not the
 * last one ever comes.
 *
 * A layer whose read failed keeps no count, for the reason above: the row
 * without one is what every row looks like for the first second, and `+0 −0`
 * would call a four thousand line change nothing.
