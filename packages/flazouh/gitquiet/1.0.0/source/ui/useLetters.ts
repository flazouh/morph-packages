 * and threading the profile through six components that have no opinion about
 * keyboards is how a prop ends up being passed by every component in a codebase.
 *
 * The default is the standard profile, so a menu rendered by a test or by a
 * screen that has not got around to providing this still answers to its letters.

 * The letters whatever is on top answers to, as a handler it can wear.
 *
 * Handed to the element the reader is inside — a menu's content, a dialogue's
 * panel — rather than added to the document, and that is the whole design. The
 * page's own keyboard deliberately stands down while a menu of ours is up (see
 * `useKeys`), because Escape and `s` belong to the innermost thing on the screen;
 * a second document listener for these would be that rule broken by the layer
 * that wrote it. A handler on the thing that is up is only live while it is.
 *
 * A press that is answered is taken firmly out of the air. Three things would
 * otherwise hear it: the menu's own typeahead, which jumps focus to whatever item
 * starts with that letter; GitHub's page underneath, where half these letters are
 * their own shortcuts; and the browser. Radix reads a prevented default as "this
 * press was somebody else's", so preventing it here is also how its typeahead is
 * told to leave the key alone.
 *
 * Nothing is answered where the reader has turned the keyboard off. That setting
 * exists so somebody who lives in GitHub's own shortcuts keeps them untouched,
 * and a letter that closed a pull request from inside our menu would be exactly
 * the surprise they turned it off to avoid.
