 * here draws comes out of that HTML — a card is read from GitHub's API — so the
 * document was work nobody ever saw, paid for in front of a reader who had already
 * said where they wanted to be.
 *
 * The address still moves. It is the address of the thing on the screen, and the
 * back button, a copied link, a reload and the browser's own history all have to
 * mean exactly what they say. What does not happen is the fetch.

 * cache, a big repository's list can still be standing up when the first
 * deadline fires, and the repair then loaded a whole document over a press that
 * was working — which also threw away every live screen this document was
 * holding for Back. Reproduced on live github.com by

 *
 * So a deadline that finds the arrival still moving — see `stillArriving`: the

 * below puts the forced answer at 10.5s. That is deliberately past everyone
 * else's give-ups: the shell drops the gate at eight, and a screen whose read
 * fails draws its failure or steps aside well before that. By the last check a
 * working arrival has finished or given up on itself, and what is left really
 * is not coming.
 *
 * This is a count of checks and not a span, so an arrival that goes in and out
 * of view stretches it: only a check that finds movement spends one, and each

 * Answers presses on the links a screen drew, in place of the browser.

 * only ever answer for what this extension put on the page. Hands back the way to
 * stop.
 *
 * Which addresses it answers is the screen's own to say, because the screen is
 * the only thing that knows what it can hand its surface over to. A list of pull
 * requests can hand over to any of them; the card can hand over to the list it
 * came from, and deliberately not to another pull request — that one would have
 * to stand in a region GitHub has not rendered, and asking them for the document
 * is the honest way there.
