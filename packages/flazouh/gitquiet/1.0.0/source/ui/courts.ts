 * CONTEXT.md's four Courts, in the words it names them by.
 *
 * One word each for the last three, and that is the point of them: Waiting means
 * a person owes the next step, Running means a machine does. The heading they
 * replaced said "Waiting On Others" over both, and over a stranger's pull request
 * nobody was waiting on at all.
 *
 * Their own file because two screens name them now. The Working Set sorts pull
 * requests across repositories into these four, and the panel at the top of one
 * pull request sorts that pull request's own pieces into the same four. They are
 * one idea at two sizes, and a reader who learns the words on the list has
 * learnt them for the pull request as well — which only holds while there is one
 * place the words come from.

 * differ. They are the same four sentences either way, so they are written once.

 * because this page is scanned rather than read: the headers are what the eye lands on
 * first, and a shape is recognised before a word.

 * The same four glyphs, with the one that moves made to earn it.
 *
 * A turning circle says a machine is working right now. The Court says only that
 * a machine has the next move, and the two come apart on a pull request whose
 * checks have all passed and whose Running holds an answered finding: nothing is
 * queued, nothing is coming back, and the heading turned all the same. Found on
 * `octo-org/octo-repo#1787`, where it turned over fourteen green checks.
 *
 * At rest it borrows the dot a queued check wears, which is the distinction
 * `checkArt` already draws for a row: running and queued are not the same wait,
 * one is happening and the other has not started. A Court nothing is running in
 * is the second kind, so the heading is the row's own answer made larger — which
 * is what the turning circle was borrowed for in the first place.
