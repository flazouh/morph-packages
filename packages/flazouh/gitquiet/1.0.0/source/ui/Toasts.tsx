/**
 * What the interface says when the thing it showed you turns out to be wrong.
 *
 * An optimistic list needs somewhere to put a refusal. The row moved the moment
 * it was asked for, GitHub said no a second later, and the row moved back — and
 * without a sentence, that is a list that shuffled itself for reasons nobody was
 * told. The control that asked is usually gone by then: the menu closed on the
 * press, which is the point of showing the change immediately.
 *
 * Bottom right, which is where it ended up rather than where it started.
 *
 * The top middle was chosen on the argument that it is the one place belonging to nobody else
 * and the place a reader's eyes already are. The second half of that turned out to be the
 * problem: a reader's eyes are at the top of the list because that is where they are working,
 * and a sentence printed over the row they are pointing at interrupts the thing it is reporting
 * on. It also put the toast under our own bar, which is a strip at the top centre of every page
 * this extension takes over.
 *
 * The corner is out of the way of both and still in view. Right rather than left because the
 * Rail is on the left in both shells, and bottom because a list grows downwards: the newest row
 * is never the one a toast covers.
 *
 * Only a press gets a sentence. Every screen used to raise one when a background read landed
 * over content the reader was already reading — "Pull request updated", "Run updated", eleven
 * of them — which is one interruption per page for something nobody asked for and nothing to
 * decide about. The new content is on the screen; that is the whole report. Toasts are kept
 * for the two cases the page cannot show on its own: a refusal after the row already moved,
 * and a way back out of a verb that has already happened.
 */

/**
 * Every toast wears the card's own dress, in both shells' tokens.
 *
 * A fill and a shadow, no edge. A toast is the one thing here that genuinely floats
 * over the page, and a shadow is the only mark that says how far off it is; the line
 * around it was the third thing saying what the fill and the shadow already said.

 *
 * Sonner's `Toaster` is not free to mount. It reads the document's writing
 * direction, which is `getComputedStyle` on the root of GitHub's page, and it
 * flushes React synchronously to measure the toasts it is holding. Measured on a
 * press between two pull requests: 94ms in `getDocumentDirection` and 123ms in
 * the flush, on every screen this extension stands up — for a corner of the
 * screen that is empty on all but a handful of them.
 *
 * So it is mounted when there is something to say and not before. A screen that
 * never refuses anything never pays for it, and a screen that does pays once,
 * after the press it is reporting on rather than during it.
 *
 * Counted and held by identity, for the same reason `Standing` above counts. Two
 * screens are on the page at once at every navigation, on purpose: `screen.tsx`
 * takes the outgoing root down from `whenAnotherBarStands`, up to `HANDOVER`
 * after the incoming one has already mounted. A single slot and a single flag are
 * written by whichever screen ran last and cleared by whichever screen leaves
 * first, and those are not the same screen. The leaving one took the surface away
 * from the one still standing, and the extension went mute for the rest of the
 * document: press a pull request from a list, press back, and no refusal, no way
 * back and no read in progress was ever said again.
 *
 * A set and a count are right under any overlap and any order of leaving. A slot
 * and a flag are right under neither.

 * inside it is sorted against its siblings and then the whole context is placed as one thing.
