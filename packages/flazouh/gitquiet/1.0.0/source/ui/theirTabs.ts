 * which would also mean nothing to press to change your mind, and a preference
 * that can only be undone from a browser's extension settings is a preference
 * that traps people. So one control goes back: at the end of their own tab row,
 * dressed as the tabs beside it, saying what it does.
 *
 * Their row and not a corner of the window, because that row is already the
 * place on this page where you choose what to look at. A floating button would
 * have been easier and would have sat on top of their page announcing itself
 * forever.
