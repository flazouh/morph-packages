/**
 * The stacks among a set of pull requests, as a forest of roots.
 *
 * GitHub serves no stack identifier. Its rows carry `stackPosition` and
 * `stackSize`, which look like the answer and are not: measured against a real
 * three-deep chain both come back null, so they describe some stacking of
 * GitHub's own rather than the ordinary kind made by basing one branch on
 * another. `stackedBaseRefName` is no better — on a chain GitHub keeps no stack
 * of its own for it equals `baseRefName` rather than naming the trunk, so it
 * cannot pick out a root either. It names the trunk only inside a stack GitHub
 * holds, which is the one thing `Stack.floor` reads it for.
 *
 * What is left is each pull request's base and head branch, and that is enough,
 * because a stack is exactly the chain those two facts describe: a pull request
 * whose base is another's head merges into that one, so it sits above it and
 * cannot land until it has.
 *
 * A root is a pull request whose base belongs to no pull request in the set.
 * That covers both the ordinary cases: based directly on trunk, or based on a
 * branch whose own pull request has already merged and left the Working Set.
 *
 * Total by construction. Every member comes back exactly once however tangled
 * the input — which matters more here than it looks, because a row drawn twice
 * is a pull request somebody reviews twice, and a row dropped is one they never
 * see. The guard earns itself against a cycle: two pull requests each based on
 * the other cannot happen in git, but they can happen in two payloads read at
 * different moments, and an unguarded walk recurses until the stack runs out.
