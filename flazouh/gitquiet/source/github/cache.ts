 * request that could drift from the first; there is no such risk in two branch
 * names and two integers, and the alternative — keeping the merge boxes they came
 * out of — is fifty kilobytes a row to recover eighty bytes of it.
 *

 *
 * So the list opened from memory sorted one way, and the live read re-sorted it
