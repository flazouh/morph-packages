/**
 * What this extension's own writes have just made true, held for as long as
 * GitHub takes to agree.
 *
 * GitHub's page data is eventually consistent. For a second or two after a merge
 * their own `changes` route still answers open, so a read taken in that window
 * comes back describing a pull request the reader has already landed — and every
 * surface reading through the gateway draws it. The card goes from Merged to
 * Open in front of somebody who merged it.
 *
 * A write is the one moment this codebase knows a state for certain: GitHub
 * answered 200 to a request that says what it did. So the write writes it down
 * here and the reads wear it until GitHub says the same thing.
 *
 * In memory to be read, and in the store to survive a document. Reading has to be
 * a map lookup: every shelf and every row is decoded through here, and a decode
 * that awaited storage would be a decode that could not be a function. So the map
 * is the answer, and the store is only how the map is refilled — seeded once
 * before the first listing decodes, written after every write.
 *
 * Keeping it at all outside one document is the part that changed. It used to be
 * memory alone, on the reasoning that this covers the seconds between a write and
 * GitHub catching up and a reopened document is long past them. Two of those
 * seconds are the Working Set's own read, which is their search, and their search
 * index is behind by minutes rather than seconds: close a pull request, open
 * GitHub in a new tab, and their list has it under Needs You with nothing here to
 * say otherwise. See `forget` in `cache.ts` for the other durable half, which
 * drops what was kept rather than correcting it.
