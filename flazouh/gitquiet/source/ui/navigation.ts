/**
 * Noticing that GitHub has gone somewhere else without loading a page.
 *
 * GitHub navigates with Turbo: clicking a pull request in a list swaps the
 * document's contents and rewrites the address bar, and no page load happens at
 * all. A content script is started once per document, so without this it goes
 * on believing it is looking at whichever pull request it was injected on, and
 * the interface for that one stays standing over a page about something else.
 *
 * `soft-nav:start` is the event GitHub fires, and it fires *before* the address
 * has changed — it announces the intention, not the arrival. So it is used only
 * as a prompt to start looking, and what is actually watched is the address
 * itself. `popstate` covers the back and forward buttons, and the interval
 * covers everything neither of them mentions, which on a page belonging to
 * somebody else is the case worth planning for.
 *
 * The browser's own account of it comes first, though — see {@link theirWord}.

 * hundred milliseconds late, this can answer in the same task.
 *
 * The interval stays underneath it. This is a young API and the page belongs to
 * somebody else — a browser without it, or a way of moving it does not report,
 * costs a fifth of a second rather than everything.

 * where it was. Reproduced with this extension uninstalled, by pressing their own
 * tabs at their own coordinates, so it is a defect we inherit rather than cause.
 *
 * A reader cannot be left with a page that ignores them, so the press is carried
 * out here instead. A whole document loads, which is the slow way and the reason
 * this waits rather than doing it first: where their router works, this never
 * fires at all.
 *
 * The address is the only thing it goes on, because nothing else they emit tells
 * a dead press from a live one. So a soft navigation this never heard about, a
 * press the reader replaced with another, and a press that went somewhere
 * unexpected are all left alone. The one case this acts on is the page standing
 * exactly where it was when the deadline runs out.
