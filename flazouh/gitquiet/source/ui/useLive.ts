     *
     * Recorded on a live GitHub, arriving at `flazouh/ghpro-scratch/pulls`: the
     * remembered list whole on the screen at 1010ms, the read's first stage over the
     * top of it at 1423ms — the reader's own five rows regrouped from "Needs You" to
     * "Waiting", every check gone — and the whole list back at 1736ms. Then walking
     * out of pull request 10 onto that same list: whole at 6394ms, the stage at
     * 7153ms, whole again at 7619ms. Most of a second of a list taking itself apart
     * and putting itself back together, on the way to saying what it already said.
     * See `scripts/probe-flicker-dom.js`, which is what recorded it.
     *

     * can compare two pages and say which is the fuller one, and it does not have to:
     * where a memory arrived, there is a whole page on the screen already, and the
