 *
 * Two sets, and the reader picks. The default picks for them by place: GitHub's
 * own glyphs on GitHub's page, ours in a window of ours. That default was once
 * hardcoded per shell, then collapsed to a single set on the grounds that both
 * shells were handing down the same one and the second table was only drift
 * waiting to happen — a third copy in the desktop workspace had gone
 * twenty-seven names behind and did not compile. The drift argument was right
 * and the conclusion was not: what it argues for is one table per set with the
 * `Set` type over both, which is what this is, rather than one set for everyone.
 *
 * Named for the meaning and not the picture: `check-passed` rather than
 * `check-circle-fill`, because the one thing a replacement set must preserve is
 * what the glyph means, and a name that describes a filled circle is a name that
 * lies the moment somebody draws a tick.
